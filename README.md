# Product Sales Data Processing Prototype with Python üêç

Welcome to this prototype Python project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of product sales data processing. This repo is a simplified example focused on the logic and structure of processing sales data without actual CSV file handling.

## üöÄ Features

- Core Python scripts illustrating sales data processing workflows
- Modular and easy-to-understand Python code for basic sales operations
- Emphasis on data handling logic without external dependencies
- Command-line friendly scripts for quick testing and learning

## üéØ Purpose

This prototype project aims to provide students, developers, and data enthusiasts with a clean, readable example of product sales data processing algorithms implemented in Python. It is ideal for learning or as a foundation before integrating real data sources such as CSV files or databases.

## üîß Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadrossiramadhan/Product-Sales-Data-Processing-With-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd Product-Sales-Data-Processing-With-Python
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts to explore and test the core data processing logic!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This project currently does not include CSV file reading or writing functionality. It focuses on the backend logic prototype for processing sales data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

## üì¨ Feedback & Contributions

Contributions to extend this prototype into a full-featured sales data processor with file handling are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests!
