# Product Sales Data Processing Prototype with Python 🐍

Welcome to this prototype Python project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of product sales data processing. This repo is a simplified example focused on the logic and structure of processing sales data without actual CSV file handling.

## 🚀 Features

- Core Python scripts illustrating sales data processing workflows
- Modular and easy-to-understand Python code for basic sales operations
- Emphasis on data handling logic without external dependencies
- Command-line friendly scripts for quick testing and learning

## 🎯 Purpose

This prototype project aims to provide students, developers, and data enthusiasts with a clean, readable example of product sales data processing algorithms implemented in Python. It is ideal for learning or as a foundation before integrating real data sources such as CSV files or databases.
